Handwritten Digit Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks in Python with Keras

## Description
This is a 5 layers Sequential Convolutional Neural Network for digits recognition trained on MNIST dataset. I choosed to build it with keras API (Tensorflow backend) which is very intuitive.

It achieved 98.51% of accuracy with this CNN trained on a GPU, which took me about a minute. If you dont have a GPU powered machine it might take a little longer, you can try reducing the epochs (steps) to reduce computation.
